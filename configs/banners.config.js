 * These mic banners are used to provide information about the file, author,
 * license, and version. They are meant to be modified to fit your theme. 
 * The banners are added to the files at build time for both the development
 * and production versions of the theme.
 * 
 * Should you not wish to use the banners, you can remove them from the builds
 * by editing the 'theme.config.js' file and setting the 'useBanners' property
 * to 'false' (it is true by default).
